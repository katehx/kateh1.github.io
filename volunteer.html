        <h2>Volunteering</h2>

        <h3><em>FIRST&reg;</em> Robotics</h3>
        <p><em>FIRST&reg;</em> Robotics is a nonprofit educational, competition based, robotics organization for students K-12. There are three programs (FLL, FTC, and FRC) that have varrying age levels, robot construction rules, and game challenges. Every year/season <em>FIRST&reg;</em> reveals a new set of challenges and teams must spend the next 2-6 months designing, building, and programming their robots to bring to competition. Teams will compete in a head to head format to score as many points as possible in 2.5 minute matches. Through <em>FIRST&reg;</em> students build real world skills that held prepare them for the work force where they can take on the world of STEM.</p>

                <h5>How much time do I spend volunteering?</h5>
                <p>After participating in <em>FIRST&reg;</em> for 5 years as a student myself I love to give back to my community as an alumni! I largely acredit <em>FIRST&reg;</em> as the reason I am in the STEM field today. Getting to hopefully give current students a similar experience motivates me to spend a significant portion of my free time at events!</p>
